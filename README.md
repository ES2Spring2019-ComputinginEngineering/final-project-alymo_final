You should include in your final project readme a description of the project, a list of all the files that you have created and instructions for use.

This readme is written in a language called markdown. This is not a programming language but a formatting langauge. There are symbols (syntax) used to indicate how to format the text. For example the pound symbol (i.e. the hashtag) is used to format a title; two of the same symbol format a heading, and three format a sub-heading.

Below is some example text in markdown however this alone is not suffiecent for the final project. **Make sure you follow the directions on Canvas.**

# Baseball Statistics

Our program takes in batting statistics (batting average, on base percentage, etc) of a team and uses optimization functions (unique to each batter) to return the best lineup, which will maximize the amount of runs scored. It then tests this hypothesized lineup by simulating a game by running through the batting lineup over nine innings by looking at who is on base and the chance of the batter to get on base to determine the final score of the game.

## Instructions

Describe how the users(instructors) should run your code to see an ***easy to run example of the functionality***. This should all be in a *main.py* "driver" script.

## File List

Create a list of all of the files in your repository with one sentence descriptions 

## How to format your readme

In your readme, you can:
```
Give code examples
```

You can also include useful links, like this one with information about [formatting markdown](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
